<h1>Spotify Clone</h1>
Welcome to the Spotify Clone project! This project is a simple yet functional music player that replicates the basic features of Spotify. It is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the need for any backend or frontend frameworks.

Features

Playlist Management: Users can add and remove playlists directly from the website.

Playback Controls: Play, pause, skip to the next or previous song with ease.

Playlist Looping: When reaching the end of a playlist, the player automatically starts playing the first song again.

Slider for Track Navigation: A slider allows users to navigate through the track at any point.

Volume Control: Increase or decrease the volume of the track using the volume button.

Library Access: All tracks are available in the library section for each playlist. Selecting a song from the library plays it instantly.
